# 📋 Project Summary — SOFIYA v4.3.0

## 🌌 Vision

**SOFIYA** is designed to be the ultimate bilingual browser companion. It bridges the gap between high-tech "Iron Man" style interfaces and practical, everyday utility by providing a voice-first experience that speaks the user's language—literally.

## 🏗️ Technical Foundation

- **Frontend**: React 19 (Functional Components + Hooks)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Custom Vanilla CSS Glassmorphism
- **Logic**: TypeScript 5.8 (Strict Mode)
- **Voice**: Web Speech API (Recognition & Synthesis)
- **Audio**: Procedural Web Audio API for UI feedback
- **AI**: OpenRouter API (Conversational Fallback)

## 🚀 Key Achievements in v4.3.0

1. **Modular Logic**: Successfully decoupled the assistant's massive state machine into a standalone `useAssistant` hook, improving scalability.
2. **Interactive UI**: Transformed the passive command marquee into an interactive tool, significantly reducing the friction for new users.
3. **Advanced Intelligence**: Implemented Smart Routines (`ROUTINE_MORNING`, `ROUTINE_NIGHT`) and a functional **News Uplink** using the RSS-to-JSON API.
4. **Enhanced Bilingualism**: Fine-tuned the language detection engine to handle "Hinglish" (mixed Hindi/English) with high confidence.

## 📊 Current Capabilities

- **Voice Control**: 60+ supported intents across English and Hindi.
- **Widgets**: Weather, Live Global News, Health, Smart Home, Media, Tasks, Timer, Calculator.
- **Visuals**: 4 dynamic protocols (Themes) that change the entire UI color scheme and personality.
- **Security**: Built-in sanitization and sensitive keyword blocking.

## 🛣️ Experimental Features

- **Sentry Mode**: Real-time motion detection using `getUserMedia`.
- **Mindfulness**: Procedural audio-guided breathing exercises.
- **AI Conversation**: Context-aware chat via OpenRouter models.
